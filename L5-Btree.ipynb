    "B-Trees are a self-balancing search-trees with fast search, insertion and deletion, where nodes can have many children.\n",
    "\n",

    "The key idea is to optimize for realistic memory hierarchy by making the number of children as large as possible, but so that each node remains within a single disc block and requires just one memory access. A shallow-wide tree requires few accesses to main memory. For a tree with 200 children (199 keys per node) depth three contains $1 + 200 + 200^2 + 200^3 = 8,040,201$ nodes $= 1,600,000,000$ Keys!.\n",
