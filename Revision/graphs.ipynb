    "- <b>Undirected graph.</b> In a directed graph the edges have no direction associated with them. For example, a social network of friendships between people or existence of a wiring connection between electronic components on a circuit board. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Directed graph.</b> In a directed graph, relationships between vertices have a direction associated with them, such as order of execution in scheduling problems (perform task 1 before task 2) or traffic flow direction in a (potentially one way) street. <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- <b>Bipartite graph.</b> A bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$, is a graph vertex set, $V$, of which can be partitioned into two nonempty subsets $A$ and $B$ such that each edge of $G$ has one endpoint in $A$ and one endpoint in $B$. Bipartite graphs often arise in applications involving matching problems, such as assigning tasks to workers or allocating resources to projects.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "- <b>Strongly connected component.</b> A strongly connected component of a directed graph, $G=(V,E)$, is a maximal set of vertices, $C\\subseteq V$, such that for every pair of vertices, $u$ and $v$ in $C$, we have both $u\\leadsto v$ and $v \\leadsto u$. Strongly connected components are often used as a tool for understanding the structure and connectivity of directed graphs in various real-world applications (e.g. social network analysis).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### BFS\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, and a **source** vertex $S$:\n",
    "* Discover every vertex that is reachable from $S$, and queue all vertexs one layer down\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses a single FIFO queue containing some vertices at a distance k, possibly followed by some vertices at distance k+1. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of a computational problem for which BFS could be preferred is finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph. If the shortest path is significantly shorter than the possible longest simple path (ie. path without loops) then BFS would terminate much earlier before all nodes are explored. Note if DFS was used for such a problem, it could also find a path from a start node to a desired destination note, however one would not know if it is the shortest possible path. <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### DFS\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a first undiscovered vertex and explore neighbors recursively until no unexplored neighbors are left. For each vertex $v$, once all out going edges are discovered, the algorithm must backtrack to vertex from which $v$ was discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undiscovered vertices are coloured `white`, those with fully explored neighbors `black`, and the rest `gray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a computational problem that is well-suited for DFS is finding a path between two nodes in a maze or labyrinth with obstacles. In this case, DFS can be used to explore all possible paths in the maze and find a solution which is not necessarily the most optimal one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Topological Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "A Topological sort of a directed acycled graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that an edge $(u, v)$ requires $u$ appear before $v$ in the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph contains a cycle this is of course impossible. Found by DFS and reverse ordering of finish times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strongly Connected\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A strongly connected set of a directed graph is a maximal set of vertices such that for every set of vertices, there is a path from one to the other and the other to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Call `DFS` to compute the finishing times `f` for every node\n",
    "* Compute the graph's transpose $G^T$ was swapping the direction of every edge\n",
    "* Call DFS $G^T$ but in the main loop consider in order of decreasing `f`\n",
    "* Output the vertices in the depth-first forest as separately strongly connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the transposed graph, $G.T$, performing DFS in the reverse finish time order all the vertices belonging to a particular strongly connected component will be returned and no vertices of other strongly connected components will be reached. It is so because the strongly connected component with most recent finish time can not have edges going out in to other strongly connected components in the transposed graph. Otherwise, there would be a strongly connected component with an even more recent finish time. Once the vertices in the particular SCC component are explored, the next vertex to be explored will be from another SCC which only has edges leading into the already explored SCC, and hence visiting any vertex in this SCC will visit all vertices in that SCC and no vertices in other SCC's. <br>\n",

    "#### MWST\n",
    "\n",
    "MST's can be constructed by using greedy strategy maintaining the following\n",
    "invariant: prior each iteration, A is a subset of some minimum spanning tree. At each\n",
    "step a (safe) edge which respects such invariant is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic MST:\n",
    "* $A$ is the empty set\n",
    "* while $A$ does not form an MST\n",
    "* find an edge that is safe and add it to $A$\n",
    "* An edge is a light edge crossing a cut if its weight is the minimum of those that cross\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence any *light edge* is safe to be appended to $A$ Greedily\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Kruskal\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a growing collection of multiple forests. Find a safe edge to add to the forest by finding all edges that connect any two trees and choosing the light edge. Automatically ends when all edges are accessible in a single forest.\n",

    "* Start from an arbitrary root $r$\n",
    "* Edges in the set $A$ always form a single tree\n",
    "* Each step adds a light edge to $A$ that connects $A$ to an isolated vertex\n",
    "* Each vertex stores the minimum weight of any edge connected from the vertex to another in the tree\n",
    "* Vertices also store their parent\n",
    "* $Q$ is a min-priority queue, used to find the light edge based on the vertex edge min weight above\n",

    "### Shortest Path From Source\n",
    "\n",
    "If a graph contains no negative weight cycles reachable from the source vertex, then the shortest path is well defined, and may even have a negative value. \n",
    "\n",
    "we define the **shortest paht weight from $u$ to $v$** as $\\delta(u, v)$\n",
    "\n",

    "* For $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq k$ be the subpath of $p_{ij}$ from $v_i$ to $v_j$\n",
    "* Then $p_{ij}$ is also a shortest path\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms can be formalised as a repeated **relaxation**, testing whether the shortest path can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Triangle Inequality** - For an edge $(u, v)$, $\\delta(S, v) \\leq \\delta(S, u) + w(u, v)$ \n",
    "* **Upper Bound** - once $v.d$ reaches $\\delta$ it never changes\n",
    "* **No path** - If there is no path, then $\\delta = \\inf$\n",
    "* **Relaxation** - If $p = < v_0, v_1,..., v_k>$ is a shortest path, and we relax the edges in order, then the final vertex in p will have $v.d = \\delta$ regardless of other steps\n",
    "* **Predescessor subgraph** - once all $v.d = \\delta$, the predecessor graph is a shortest path tree routed at $s$\n",

    "#### Ford-Fulkerson\n",
    "\n",
    "* An edge of the flow can admit an amount of additional flow = capacity - existing flow\n",
    "    * This is called the *residual capacity* $c_f$\n",
    "* The residual network is a graph of edges with capacities that represent how the flow can be changed\n",
    "* An **augmenting path** is a simple path from $s$ to $t$ in the residual network\n",
    "* The maximum amount by which we can increase the flow on an augmenting path is called its residual capacity as before\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ford-Fulkerson method iteratively increases the value of the flow starting from 0. Each iteration \n",
    "increases the flow value in $G$ by finding an *augmenting path* in an associated *residual network*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent a possible decrease in the positive flow $f(u, v)$ on an edge in $G$, the residual network  contains an edge $(v, u)$ with residual capacity $c_f(v, u) = f(u, v)$. that is, an edge that can admit flow in the\n",
    "opposite direction, at most canceling out the flow on $(u, v)$.\n",

    "A **matching** in a bipartite graph is a set of edges in which no two edges share a common vertex. A maximum matching is the largest possible matching that can be achieved in such a graph. \n",

    "\n",
    "The value of the maximum flow found for this flow network will be equal to the maximum bipartite matching in the original bipartite graph.\n",
    "The intuition behind this is as follows:\n",
    "1. Any valid set of matches can be represented as a corresponding valid flow in the flow network (i.e. a particular match $a-b$ would be represented as a flow $s-a-b-t$ of size 1).\n",
    "2. Any valid integer valued flow in the flow network can be represented by a set of matches. Since the flow is limited to a capacity of 1 for each edge, no two edges share a common vertex, which is the definition of a matching in a bipartite graph.\n",
