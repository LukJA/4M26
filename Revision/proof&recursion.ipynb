    "using a loop invariant, you need to show three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialization:** It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.\n",
    "* **Maintenance:** If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.\n",
    "* **Termination:** The loop terminates, and when it terminates, the invariant usually along with the reason that the loop terminated gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### e.g. proof for insertion sort\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Final Invariant** - Elements $S[:j]$ are sorted before the $j$-th iteration\n",
    "2. **Initialisation** - True for $j=1$ as a single item list is sorted\n",
    "3. **Maintenance**- True for $j=k$, show must be true for $j=k+1$. Informally the while loop works by shifting items up the sorted list until the correct spot is found, hence $S[:k+1]$ is sorted.\n",
    "4. **Termination** - At for loop end we have $j=n$ such that $S[:n]$ must be sorted\n",

    "* If $y = u$ then $u.d=\\delta(s,u)$ as vertex $u$ should have been relaxed after the vertex $x$ had been explored. \n",
    "* If $y\\neq u$ then $y.d < u.d$ since we only consider non-negative edges and $u.d > \\delta(s,u)$. Which is a contradiction as then we should have selected $y$ from the queue!\n",

    "\n",
    "This property states: \n",
    "* if $p=\\langle v_0,v_1,\\cdots,v_k \\rangle$ is a shortest path from $s=v_0$ to $v_k$, and we relax all the edges of $p$ in the order $(v_0,v_1),(v_1,v_2),\\cdots,(v_{k-1},v_k)$\n",
    "* then $v.k=\\delta(s,v_k)$. \n",
    "* This property holds regardless any other relaxations steps that occur. \n",
    "* The outer loop runs $\\lvert V -1\\rvert$ times and any shortest path is not longer than $\\lvert V -1 \\rvert$ edges\n",
