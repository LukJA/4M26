    "## Red Black BST Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Red Black Trees** (RBTs) are a modified BST, that add rules to ensure insertions and deletions result in more balanced final tree structures, hence they are known as 'self-balancing'. As many of the tasks of BSTs are $O(h)$, this gives assuredly fast _search, insertion and deletion_ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a RST each node has a color (Red or Black) and if a node has no left or right child, these point to a common \"Nil\" Node, that is logically black. The tree is always approximately balanced with Tree Height $h = \\Theta( \\log n)$.\n",
