    "## Hash Tables\n",

We *could* have an $m$ slot array and just use keys as indexes in $O(1)$, but super inefficient.\n",

    "An **Ideal $h(k)$** would roll a fair, random, $m$-sided die to select a slot for each $k$ - An independent uniform random hash function. However input data is rarely random, so good hash functions must be very random!\n",
